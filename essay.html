             <hi> NEW YORK'S PIZZERIA: </hi>


             Walking down Saint Marks Place in downtown Manhattan you won’t see the same thing twice. People of all different identities and backgrounds shoulder to shoulder in the busy streets rushing to who knows where. If you want to get something to eat you have many choices, but one always stands out. 2 Bros Pizza, the small hole-in-the-wall pizza place that always seems to have a line twirling out the store. Of course there's many fancy restaurants and expensive diners surrounding it, but 2 Bros always seems to get more attention. The classic dollar pizza slice is something so simple yet so true to New York.
             The line in 2 Bros is more diverse than a college brochure. From the businessman coming home from the huge corporate buildings on Cooper Square to the group of drunk college students that just left Washington Square Park, everyone is looking for a quick slice to get them through the day. As you get to the front of the line the pizza oven blasts warm air in your face as you try to give the worker your order as he tries to do three other things at the same time. Once you get your pizza you pray that one of the three tables is open. If you get lucky you’ll get to take a seat in the hectic environment. Inside the store it's much more relaxing, the dirty tables with music you can't understand playing on the speakers, you get a chance to observe the environment around you. The people surrounding you that seemingly have zero face value all come together in one location to enjoy the timeless New York meal, the dollar pizza.
             The dollar pizza slice has become scarce in the streets of New York recently. The pizza place just two blocks down from 2 Bros that has been ninety-nine cents for as long as I remember has changed to 1.50 along with nearly every other place in the city. They even still have the sign on the top of the store reading “99 CENT PIZZA,” Just now accompanied with a stand up sign right out front clarifying that it’s now 1.50. However 2 Bros never changed. 2 Bros’ decision to keep the price of one dollar makes it stand out to New Yorkers, even people that could afford all the pizza in the world recognize 2 Bros as the spot that always has and always will be there.
             The truth is the pizza really isn’t anything special. Obviously it’s great, in my opinion much better than other dollar slices, but it isn’t the pizza that really makes 2 Bros what it is. I had a friend from my old summer camp come to the city recently and wanted me to show him around. Of course I had to take him to all the normal tourist locations like Times Square and The One World Trade Center, but that night I decided to take him to 2 Bros to get dinner. It was a busy summer night and the line was long as expected. Thankfully we got a seat and he seemed fascinated by the place more than pretty much anything we had seen that day. It was only then I realized how special 2 Bros really was, living in the suburbs of Delaware he had never seen so many different types of people in one tiny little area all with the same goal, to get a slice. Grubhub workers that have been biking all day taking a much needed break, wealthy CEOs working dusk to dawn, struggling people on the brink of poverty stumbling out of Tompkins Square Park, all find themselves together at 2 Bros Pizza.
